# Domestic Linkages, Trade Structure, and Standards  
## Evidence from Input–Output Analysis and India–EU Trade

### Overview
This repository contains a research paper examining the structural relationship between India’s domestic production network and its trade with the European Union, in the context of the proposed India–EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA).

The study combines **input–output linkage analysis** with **sectoral trade data** to evaluate whether recent trade outcomes reflect deepening domestic industrial capability or continued dependence on imported intermediates and capital goods.

Rather than analysing trade balances in isolation, the paper links **domestic backward and forward linkages (2010–2022)** with **India–EU trade patterns (2017–2025)** and introduces an **energy vs non-energy decomposition** of the trade balance to distinguish structural trends from price-driven effects.

### Research Questions
- How have India’s domestic backward and forward production linkages evolved over time?
- Which sectors are structurally embedded within India’s production network?
- How do these structural characteristics relate to India–EU trade patterns?
- Are recent trade surpluses driven by industrial capability or energy-related factors?
- What do these findings imply for the India–EU Free Trade Agreement and regulatory standards?

### Methodological Framework
The analysis is grounded in classical development economics and input–output theory, drawing on the works of **Hirschman**, **Chenery**, and **Leontief**.

Key methodological steps include:
- Construction of **domestic Leontief inverse matrices** using published input–output tables
- Measurement of **domestic backward (BLᵈ) and forward (FLᵈ) linkages**
- Longitudinal comparison of linkage patterns across 50 production sectors (2010–2022)
- Sectoral classification based on linkage intensity (Intermediate vs Final; Manufacturing vs Primary)
- HS-level trade analysis of India–EU imports and exports (2017–2025)
- **Energy vs non-energy trade balance decomposition** to isolate structural trade outcomes

The study focuses exclusively on **domestic production linkages**, treating imports as competitive and excluding them from the domestic inter-industry matrix.

### Data Sources
- **OECD Input–Output Tables** (India, 2010–2022)
- **Government of India (DGFT)** merchandise trade statistics (India–EU, HS classification)
- Annual trade data aggregated at sectoral and commodity-group levels

### Key Findings
- Aggregate domestic linkage intensity in India has remained broadly stable over time, but **sectoral dispersion has increased**, indicating uneven structural deepening.
- Manufacturing sectors such as **machinery, transport equipment, metals, chemicals, and textiles** exhibit strong backward linkages, supporting upstream domestic production.
- Forward linkages are concentrated in **basic metals, energy, transport, and services**, highlighting their role as economy-wide input providers.
- India’s imports from the EU are dominated by **capital- and technology-intensive goods**, including machinery, electrical equipment, aircraft, and precision instruments.
- India’s exports to the EU are concentrated in **labour-intensive manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, basic materials, and refined petroleum products**.
- Post-2021 trade surpluses are **largely driven by energy-related exports**, while the **non-energy trade balance remains structurally fragile**.
- Trade liberalisation benefits are constrained by **domestic production structure and standards compliance capacity**, not tariffs alone.

---

### Policy Implications
The findings suggest that the gains from the India–EU FTA will depend critically on:
- Strengthening domestic intermediate manufacturing capabilities
- Reducing import dependence in forward-linked, capital-intensive sectors
- Aligning trade liberalisation with domestic production capacity
- Addressing regulatory and standards-related barriers through capability-building rather than tariff concessions alone

Without structural readiness, deeper trade integration risks reinforcing existing patterns of import dependence rather than generating sustained industrial upgrading.
